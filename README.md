Profile and produce code-coverage reports for OpenBD applications

The Open Bluedragon Journaling Tool is a means to perform in-depth analysis of code coverage, file usage, and line-by-line execution traces of your OpenBD CFML applications on a per-request basis. This tool is intended to live inside an OpenBD web application as another directory. The Journaling Tool consumes journal files produced by the Journaling feature in OpenBD [currently only available in the nightly build].

#Documentation
Documentation on how to enable and configure journaling in your OpenBD web application can be found at http://openbd.org/manual/?/journal

# Installation
Download the OpenBD Journaling Tool zip, then unzip this into your OpenBD web application. The Journaling Tool is now able to be accessed as if it were another directory within your app. Upon entering the tool, you will be prompted for a password. The password is currently "openbdjournal", however in the near future the password will be configured via the openbluedragon.xml. After gaining access to the tool, you will find the dashboard, where there will be a listing of the journal files available for analysis.
